            <p>
              My name is √Ångela Curzi, also known as <b>Volkova</b>. I was born
              in Mar del Plata but now I'm living in City Bell, Argentina. As a
              lifelong learner, I'm on a mission to soak up as much knowledge as
              possible before my time is up.{' '}
              <b>I believe that knowledge has the power to set us free.</b>
              <br />I finally found a job I love, CODING! I enjoy spending time
              with my computer, I eat books for dinner and I play videogames
              everytime I can. I'm on track to graduate with a degree in
              Audiovisual Arts this year - the culmination of years of hard work
              and dedication. My soulmate is a cat named <b>Ravenna</b>.
